Convert MS Access
by Josh Vangor and Joe Eberle started on 05-23-2023 - https://github.com/JoeEberle/ - josepheberle@outlook.com
Assessment and Planning:

Evaluate the existing Access system: Understand its functionality, data structure, user interface, and dependencies.
Identify pain points and limitations of the current system.
Define the objectives and requirements for the modernization project.
Data Migration:

Extract data from the Access database: Export tables, queries, and other relevant data.
Convert data to the format compatible with the new database system.
Import data into the new database management system (DBMS).
User Interface Redesign:

Design a new user interface: Consider usability, accessibility, and modern design principles.
Implement forms, reports, and other user interface components using modern web or desktop technologies.
Functionality Replication:

Analyze the functionality of the existing Access system: Identify key features and business logic.
Replicate functionality using the chosen modern technology stack: Develop new modules, workflows, and business logic.
Integration with External Systems:

Identify external systems and data sources that interact with the Access system.
Ensure seamless integration with external systems in the new tech stack.
Security Enhancements:

Assess security requirements: Implement authentication, authorization, and data encryption mechanisms.
Ensure compliance with security standards and regulations.
Performance Optimization:

Analyze performance bottlenecks in the existing Access system.
Optimize database queries, indexing, and data retrieval processes in the new system.
Testing and Quality Assurance:

Develop test cases to validate the functionality, usability, and performance of the new system.
Conduct thorough testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
User Training and Documentation:

Provide training sessions for end-users: Familiarize them with the new system and its features.
Create documentation: Develop user manuals, guides, and tutorials to support users during the transition.
Deployment and Rollout:

Plan the deployment strategy: Decide whether to roll out the new system incrementally or all at once.
Execute the deployment plan: Install and configure the new system, migrate data, and deploy to production.
Post-Implementation Support:

Monitor system performance and user feedback after deployment.
Address any issues or bugs that arise: Provide ongoing support and maintenance as needed.
Continuously improve the system based on user feedback and evolving requirements.
Documentation and Knowledge Transfer:

Document the new system architecture, design decisions, and configuration details.
Ensure knowledge transfer: Share expertise and best practices with the development team and stakeholders.
